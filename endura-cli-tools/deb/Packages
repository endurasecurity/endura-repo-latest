 # endura-cli-tools
 .
 TBD
 .
 ## Environment Settings
 .
 - **ENDURA_BATCHER_AUTOFLUSH**: true/false (default: false)
 - **ENDURA_LOG_LEVEL**: level of logging (default: info, cli supported)
 - **ENDURA_LOG_FILE**: save logs to this file (default: undefined, cli
 supported)
 - **ENDURA_TEAM_SERVER**: https://your.team.server (default: undefined, cli
 supported)
 .
 ## ADDITIONAL CHECKS:
 .
 - Inventory of libraries being used
 - Execution of deleted binaries: check if inode == 0
 - [x] Fileless Execution:
     -> track fds created via memfd_create per process
     -> check if filename starts with "/proc/self/fd/" or "/dev/fd/" indicating
 executing from fd
     -> extract fd from filename and see if found within "track fds" map
 .
 ## ISSUE: Who/what is allowed to kill our own process? use our socket?
     [x] only root users not bound to a job can kill endura
     -> only root users not bound to a job can interact with socket
 .
 ## ISSUE: not propagating attrs across forks
 - create a "tp/sched/sched_process_fork" eBPF program and copy job references
 from parent to child
 .
 ## BUG: mode derive failed
 .
 - not all events getting processed before job is removed
 - temporary workaround in job stop command:
 .
     // FIXME: best effort to allow processing of remaining events
     std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(3));
 .
 ## QUESTION: musl threading performance issues
