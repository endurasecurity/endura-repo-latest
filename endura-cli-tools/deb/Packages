 ## ADDITIONAL CHECKS:
 .
 - Inventory of libraries being used
 .
 ## BACKLOG ISSUES
 .
 ## ISSUE: likely need an "overwrite" policy
 .
 - assume github actions and the demo app
 -> runner is based on node (is this actually true?)
 -> npm install run by node
 -> node can write to anything in workspace
 - where is the "git clone" equivalent in the server logs?
 -> ANS: events were lost due to starting job before server ready
 .
 ## QUESTION: musl threading performance issues
 .
 - see:

 - adopt mimalloc? already implemented. no metrics to assess impact!!
